Submission for the 2015 Global Game Jam

Time Travel Trivia

Concept: Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure + Trivial Pursuit +Space Ship

Description: You and your fellow Tri-State bro’s are riding a tourboat with a hot tub in it until you end up trapped in a timewarp controlled by Master Ben Franklin. The only way he’ll let you go is if you answer his questions correctly. Get them wrong and you and your bro’s are trapped in time, FOREVER! Are you game, bruh?

Setting: Four people (each of them from different East Coast areas such as NYC, Jersey, Philadelphia, and Boston) are trapped in a timewarp while boarding a hot tub on a Duckboat. They have to get out of their time warp and back into their present day by answering trivia questions.

How the Rules Work: 
The group will receive a question phrased in slang and jargon delivered by Master Bro and Space Master Benjamin Franklin. The group will have thirty seconds to figure out the question and answer correctly. 
The questions are separated into rounds with five questions per round. You need to get three questions right in order to advance to the next round.
Get more than three questions wrong? Sorry bro, you lose!

How the questions work: Questions will be asked in ‘slang’ such as jawn, piece, bro, brah, etc. The group has thirty seconds figure out what exactly the answer to the question is.

For example: Who was the Vice Bro of George W’s first term in 1789?

The other players will have four to three answers in front of their screens, HOWEVER one or two of those answers are different from each other. Only one of those questions will be correct!

Player 1 sees the following on his/her screen: Quincy Adams, Alexander Graham Bell, Bo, Benjamin Franklin

Player 2 sees: Quincy Adams, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, Joe Biden

Player 3 sees: Thomas Jefferson, Bo, John Adams, James Wilkinson 

The correct answer is: John Adams

GOOD LUCK!
